Some of my projects and background experience. For more professional information please check my [Linkedin](linkedin.com/in/lyang-higa-cano/) page.

#### (2020) [Sorting Visualizer](https://lyanghiga.github.io/sorting-visualizer/)

Inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc) I did my own Sorting Visualizer. It was awesome to implement some algorithms that I didn’t use in a long time using React and JavaScript. For more details check the [repository](https://github.com/LyangHiga/sorting-visualizer).

#### (2020) [React Colors](https://lyanghiga.github.io/React-Colors/)

React Colors is the final project of [Modern React Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/), it is a clone of websites like [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and [Material UI Colors](http://materialuicolors.co/?utm_source=launchers), it is built with React, Material UI and a lot of others libraries. In this [post](...) I made a review of this course and explain better this project.

After finishing I decided to make big changes in the proposed project by using Hooks, Context API, and Reducers, for State Management. You can check the [Repository](https://github.com/LyangHiga/React-Colors) for more details.

#### (2019) [Yelp Camp](http://yelp-camp--vl.herokuapp.com/)

Yelp Camp is the final project of [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/), it is a kind of social network for campers, built-in NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, EJS, Boostrap and a lot of other cool stuff, which I explain better in this [post](...), where I also explain why I take this Bootcamp and made a review of it. You can also check the Git Hub [Repository](https://github.com/LyangHiga/yelp-camp). What is most important here is that I learn a ton in a really small space of time and I realized that I already had the whole base to learn any of this new technology.

#### (2019) Undergraduate Thesis: [“Reinforcement Learning With Nonlinear Approximation in Electronic Games”](http://www.monografias.poli.ufrj.br/monografias/monopoli10029824.pdf)

This is, for sure, the hardest project that I have already worked on. To graduate at UFRJ you must write an undergraduate thesis. I choose to work with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

In the Computer Engineering course, we are taught about Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. But I wanted to talk about something different that really get me excited, so I take some time and did a little research, so I heard about Reinforcement Learning. In the first glimpse, I knew that I had found my thesis subject. This was pretty exciting, however, I had to learn a brand new topic.

This toke time and it was difficult, but at the ending, my thesis was approved and I graduated. In this whole process, I learn a lot and I want to talk about it in more detail, so I will write some articles about Reinforcement Learning and how was my experience doing this project.

#### (2016-2018) Full Stack Developer Intern at [BNDES](https://www.bndes.gov.br/wps/portal/site/home)

I worked on [Cartão BNDES](https://www.cartaobndes.gov.br/cartaobndes/). This is such a great project! The main idea is to finance micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and individual entrepreneurs (MEIs). To get more information check the project page. Besides this feeling of doing something significant, our team was incredible, here I really learn a lot!

I was a Full Stack Developer, so I work with the Front-end (Angular), the Back-end (Java) and the Database (T-SQL). I also developed a ton of Unit Tests (J Unit). We work with SCRUM methodology and Test-driven Development.

I felt that I really played an important role, even though I was an intern, to work there was awesome!

It was a brazilian program to young undergraduate studantes to begin in scientific research by [CAPES](https://www.capes.gov.br/). I was guided by professor Henrique Cukierman, we made a study of Computer and Society and the [WOSES](https://www.cos.ufrj.br/woses2006/fale.htm) worshop.
