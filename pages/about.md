#### About this Blog

I'm Computer Engineering and I write about Computer Science and Software Development, as anyone would expect. However, in this blog, I also talk about all sorts of things that I love, like Language Learning, Literature, Backpacking trips, Science, Football ... and whatever comes in my mind.

Sometimes You gonna find some posts in other languages than Englishâ€¦ So prepared yourself!
