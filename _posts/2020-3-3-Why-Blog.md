title: Why Am I blogging ?
---

I really believe that when you start a new project, habit, or new whatever thing the first step is to know WHY are you doing this. So in this first post will explain my ‘whys’. After all, we are in 2020, blogging is ‘so 2000s’.

This story begins just after my graduation, I studied at UFRJ, one of the best universities in Brazil. I was a good student, good grades, a good internship program. I moved back to São Paulo, where I was born and all my family lives. I applied for a good job in a great company, I got a coding interview, it was not like the coding interview that I had heard about, all question were hugely theoretical, and kind of easy if compare with what we learn in Computer Science/ Engineering courses.

What I want to say is that I always thought that being a good student, have good grades, would be enough, to say the truth, in my experience, if you want something good, it is totally enough.

But I was thoroughly curious about coding interviews and if I could be accepted in a company like Google, which is a kind of dream job. My first realistic thought was “I am not prepared” because I believed that I knew it too much of theoretical things and not this much of practical things.

What I mean is that I could take a piece of paper and write, for example, about Dijkstra’s algorithm, how it works, why it works, and even its asymptotic complexity. However, I was not this sure if I could implement it easily, or even worst, I thought that I couldn’t implement, from scratch, any backend or frontend project using any modern technology like NodeJs, React, Django, Vue and so on.

At the same time, I found about these two guys, [John](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13/) and [Clément](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IlaxZf3-s8), who had done this exact thing that I was thinking about. So I decided to check what they did and what I could learn from them.

In this blog, I will talk about what I am doing to get there, my strategies, course reviews, projects, book recommendations, and so on. However when I decided to blog I realize that I always wanted to share my ideas, not only about computers and tech stuff but also about my hobbies or whatever comes in my mind. I prefer to use this kind of platform because I love to write, and it is much easier than starting a YouTube channel.

I believe this is a great way to be in control of my own learning and share ideas at the same time, so I really hope that this blog could help someone as much as I enjoy writing it.

I promise that, in the near future, will be a commentary section available, so for a while, or even in this near future, feel free to contact me in any social media listed below.

See ya!
